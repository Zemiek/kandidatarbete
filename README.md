TL:DR: Rest branch includes our final product, so go to that one.

There are four branches in this project, master, dev, develop and rest. The rest branch includes our final product and is the latest "working" version of our code. Master was only pushed to by accident and includes a very old version of our code. Dev and Develop have later versions of the code. These branches were created by miskade.
